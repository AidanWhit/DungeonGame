### TODO
* Create an explosion radius that is triggered when the explosion bullet hits a wall
	- This would be used to deal damage to enemies/damagable environment
* Create homing behavior
* Create slowing/freeze behavior


# Inventory Ideas
* The player has an inventory that they can use to hold modular upgrades (dmg, pierce, homing, shot type, etc.)
* The current gun then has its own inventory that allows these upgrades to be applied

# Different Gun idea
* There are different guns that will have randomized base stats / upgrades already applied
* Has a random amount of room for modular upgrades
* Could have different rarities that determine what range of stats they could have / number of slots for upgrades
